Practice makes perfect!

Elvis Huang starts to practice to use GitHub on this late Sunday evening.

I add the python-test directory to manage my practice for python. (2017/05/15)

Most of the exercises (ex1.py ~ ex52.py) are from the "Learn Python the hard way" 
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

I also posted different pytons codes, like pandas, numpy, matplot ...etc, on this repository.

Keeping on updating my progress in python on the Github.

Add this line to test git fetch command
