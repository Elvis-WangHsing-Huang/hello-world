Practice makes perfect!

Elvis Huang starts to practice to use GitHub on this late Sunday evening.

I add the python-test directory to manage my practice for python. (2017/05/15)

ALL the exercises (ex1.py ~ ex52.py) are from the "Learn Python the hard way" 
https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

I try to keep my progress on the Github
